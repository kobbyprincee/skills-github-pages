### **Welcome to My DevOps World!**  
Hi, I’m **Akoto Kwabena William**, a passionate DevOps Engineer dedicated to building scalable, efficient, and resilient systems. With a strong focus on automation, cloud infrastructure, and continuous delivery, I thrive on solving complex problems and optimizing workflows to deliver seamless software solutions.

### **What I Do**  
- **Cloud Infrastructure:** Designing and managing cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP) for high availability and scalability.  
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Building and maintaining robust CI/CD pipelines to enable faster and reliable software delivery.  
- **Automation:** Automating repetitive tasks using tools like Ansible, Terraform, and Jenkins to improve efficiency.  
- **Monitoring & Reliability:** Implementing monitoring and logging solutions (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack) to ensure system reliability and performance.  
- **Collaboration:** Working closely with development and operations teams to foster a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement.

### **Featured Projects**  
Here are some of the projects I’ve worked on:  
1. **Automated Cloud Deployment Pipeline**  
   - Built a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Terraform to automate infrastructure deployment on AWS.  
   - Reduced deployment time by 40%.  

2. **Kubernetes Cluster Management**  
   - Designed and deployed a scalable Kubernetes cluster for microservices architecture.  
   - Implemented monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana.  

3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
   - Developed reusable Terraform modules to provision infrastructure across multiple environments.  


4. **Multi-Cloud Disaster Recovery Solution**  
   - Designed and implemented a disaster recovery strategy spanning AWS, Azure, and GCP using Terraform and Ansible.  
   - Automated failover processes with Jenkins pipelines, ensuring zero downtime during regional outages.  
   - Reduced recovery time objective (RTO) from 4 hours to 15 minutes.  

5. **Scalable Kubernetes Cluster with Istio Service Mesh**  
   - Deployed a production-grade Kubernetes cluster on AWS EKS with Istio for service mesh capabilities.  
   - Implemented canary deployments and traffic splitting to enable seamless rollouts and rollbacks.  
   - Configured Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger for observability, monitoring, and tracing.  

6. **CI/CD Pipeline for Microservices Architecture**  
   - Built a GitOps-driven CI/CD pipeline using ArgoCD, Jenkins, and Helm for a microservices-based application.  
   - Integrated automated testing, security scanning (Trivy, OWASP ZAP), and compliance checks into the pipeline.  
   - Achieved 99.9% deployment success rate with automated rollback mechanisms.  

7. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for Multi-Region Deployment**  
   - Developed reusable Terraform modules to provision infrastructure across AWS, Azure, and GCP.  
   - Implemented a multi-region architecture with latency-based routing using AWS Route 53 and Azure Traffic Manager.  
   - Automated infrastructure drift detection and remediation using Terraform Cloud.  

8. **Serverless Data Pipeline with Event-Driven Architecture**  
   - Designed a serverless data pipeline using AWS Lambda, Step Functions, and S3 for real-time data processing.  
   - Integrated Kafka for event streaming and Snowflake for data warehousing.  
   - Reduced data processing costs by 30% compared to traditional ETL pipelines.  

9. **Zero-Downtime Database Migration**  
   - Migrated a monolithic PostgreSQL database to a distributed CockroachDB cluster with zero downtime.  
   - Used logical replication and custom scripts to ensure data consistency during the migration.  
   - Implemented monitoring and alerting using Datadog to track migration progress and performance.
